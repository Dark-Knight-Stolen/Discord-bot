It's a simple discord bot I made in my free time. Enjoy!
You need to install the libraries used in the bot before running it. To do so run "pip install (and the name of the library)"
If you want to use it as a selfbot you'll need to install discord.py-self not discord.py or it won't work. If you have discord.py already installed
uninstall it with pip uninstall discord.py. I'm not responsible for any misuse of this project against discord Tos
